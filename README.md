# Moochzo
Tired of your mates mooching you energy? Moochzo to the rescue!

# HackMyHouse
This project was created as part of the [Hack My House](https://github.com/davidchatting/hackmyhouse) day on the 16th August 2018 as part of research conducted by [David Chatting](http://www.davidchatting.com) a design-led exploration of the Smart Home and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices; questioning how these systems impact the agency of those who live there.
